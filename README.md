DCMS+ is the Data/Communications Management System, with a plus.

DCMS+ is a Linux-based webhost/webserver configuration, management, and billing system based on Qt6 using WebAssembly.

Distributions with planned support are initially Debian, with support for Ubuntu to follow shortly. Support for other distributions, and Unix systems will be added at a later date, as community interest shows.

##Licensing

DCMS+ is licensed under a modified BSD 3-clause style license. The fourth clause is intended to prevent cases where the software is provided to users over the network,
where the provider makes modifications the software but does not distribute them. When benefitting from open source software, it's important to be responsible and
contribute your modifications to the world of open-source. The fourth clause also contains a special permission exception to prevent license compatibility issues, and
hopefully avoid stumbling blocks like the CDDL vs GPLv2 issue.
