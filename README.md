DCMS+ is the Data/Communications Management System, with a plus.

DCMS+ is a Linux-based webhost/webserver configuration, management, and billing system based on Qt6 using WebAssembly.

Distributions with planned support are initially Debian, with support for Ubuntu to follow shortly. Support for other distributions, and Unix systems will be added at a later date, as community interest shows.
